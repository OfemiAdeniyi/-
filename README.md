## Project Summary
In this project, I applied advanced data science techniques to improve inventory management for PharmaCorp. By developing predictive models that factor in shelf life and market trends, I aimed to mitigate overproduction losses. My analysis led to actionable insights, helping PharmaCorp streamline inventory, minimize waste, and enhance supply chain efficiency.
## Data Set
The dataset is a comprehensive product inventory from PharmaCorp, containing key attributes such as Product_ID, Shelf_Life_Days, Sales_2021, Sales_2022, Market_Trend_Factor, Compliance_Status, Supplier_ID, Manufacturing_Location, Product_Category, Safety_Stock_Days, and Storage_Location. These fields provide critical insights into product performance, compliance, supply chain details, and market trends, making it ideal for inventory management and sales analysis.
