Project Summary
In this project, I applied advanced data science techniques to improve inventory management for PharmaCorp. By developing predictive models that factor in shelf life and market trends, I aimed to mitigate overproduction losses. My analysis led to actionable insights, helping PharmaCorp streamline inventory, minimize waste, and enhance supply chain efficiency.
